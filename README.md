# Chase
## Code for whatever project #1 of quarantine is

So as of NOW the enivronment can create a ball at some location and let that ball move according to the velocity it is given.
There aren't any other rules on the system. Next step is to make a chaser, which constantly adjusts its velocity to chase a second ball.
